The image shows a paternal chromosome (blue) and a maternal chromosome (pink) undergoing DNA replication, resulting in chromosomes that consist of two identical sister chromatids. The next step is where variation can occur: either crossing over happens or it does not. Crossing over is a process where homologous chromosomes exchange segments, leading to genetic recombination. If crossing over occurs, as depicted on the right side of the diagram, the resultant chromosomes have mixed segments of blue and pink, indicating that genetic material has been exchanged between the paternal and maternal chromosomes. Meiosis I follows, where homologous chromosomes are separated into different cells. The diagram shows two cells as a result of meiosis I, one with crossing over and one without. Subsequently, Meiosis II occurs, which is similar to mitosis, where sister chromatids are separated into different cells.
